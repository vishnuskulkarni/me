# Intro

I am a student at Columbia University pursuing my Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Over the course of my internships, I have gained significant experience in the field of AI and it's applications in healthcare, autonomous driving, social welfare and it's use in building an AI powered financial coach. I look forward to applying my skills to solve real-world problems. I graduate this Fall (December 2023) and am looking for full-time opportunities in the fields of AI, Machine Learning and more broadly Software Engineering for AI.

# Some history

- As an undergraduate student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal in India, I majored in Electronics and Communications Engineering with a specialization in Signal Processing. Over the course of my degree, my areas of interest slowly evolved from core signal processing and speech processing to digital image processing and computer vision.

- I was introduced to Reinforcement Learning and more broadly AI, during my internship at KPIT in Bangalore, where I worked on different RL algorithms and their applications in autonomous driving.

- Following the end of my internship and the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, I used the time to learn more about AI, Machine Learning and their applications. I completed several related online certifications and also worked on personal projects to gain hands-on experience.

- My interest in AI and subsequent internships and research work, eventually led me to pursue my Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning here at Columbia University.

# Geography

- I am from Bangalore, India. I grew up in equal parts Bangalore and Chennai.
- I moved to New York City for Graduate School and have since lived here.

# I like

- Football (Soccer) and [Liverpool FC](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/), having played Football all through school and college, I am a huge fan of the sport. I also love to swim!
- Aircraft. I love planes and flying. From commercial to military aircraft, I love aircraft history and design. I love going for Airshows!
- Nature, the great outdoors and wildlife.
- Music - I love all kinds of music! Growing up I played the guitar and the drums. Over the last year I have been teaching myself how to mix music and DJ (I have a DDJ-FLX4).
- Over the past 2 years, I have been particularly interested in House/Techno music and the culture around it. I love going to music festivals and concerts.
- Travel and exploring new places. I have been fortunate enough to have traveled to 15 countries so far and I hope to continue to travel more in the future.
- Cooking and baking! I love cooking different kinds of food and am always looking to explore new recipes and cuisines. I love food and I love to eat!
<!-- - Photography, videography and video editing. I don't think I'm particularly good at it, but I enjoy it nonetheless. -->

# Fun facts

- I have a personally curated dataset of everything I've done in 2023. Well, not everything, but a lot of things. My dataset logs everytime I do anything worth logging. I have information about the location, date, people I was with, categories of activity and notes. I created this dataset (which I fill using a Notion template I created) so that 10 years from now, if I'm with a friend and we try to recollect what we ate or where we were in NYC at a particular time I can accurately access information about that event. It's a fun personal tool and I hope to continue to maintain it.
- I can look at an aircraft in the sky and most of the time tell you what model and type it is.
- I climbed Mt. Fuji in Japan in 2018, during a Typhoon. It was a crazy experience.

# I dream of

- living on a farm one day, surrounded by my loved ones, different animals and nature.
- being happy and content with my life.
- swimming in crystal clear water in a lagoon on a warm sunny day.
- building something I am proud of, makes me happy and that has a positive impact on the world.

# Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1993 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.

- In the summer of 1996, my uncle purchased [MegaRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.

- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.

- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II.

- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.

- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents). Over the next few years, I built several more including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs.

- When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of patience. I was unstoppable.

- At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have contributed to two more.

- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.

- At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund, Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.

- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires II.

- At 18, In the summer before college, my friends and I started playing [Muggle Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(sport)). We went on to start over 8 teams in the [International Quidditch Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Quidditch_Association) including the [Buffalo Quidditch Society](https://www.facebook.com/buffaloquidditch/). At our height, we were ranked third in the IQA. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on facebook.

- At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.

- At 20, I co-authored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team for the next two years. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
